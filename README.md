# Green IT

Green IT, also known as green computing, is the practice of environmentally sustainable computing.

At any rate, the first step is to measure emissions

This document aims to outline the process of becoming aware of CHORUS's energy consumption.

## (Still) Fun Facts

1. Rebound effect/Jevons paradox: Increased efficiency induces increase in demand enough that resource use is increased, rather than reduced.

4. Environmental impact of computing
  - Life-cycle footprint of the hardware
  -   >82% of the 54m of tonnes of e-waste are handled by 12-56m informal waste workers worldwide
  - Long-term data storage
    - UK Biobank: 15 PB by 2025
    - First picture of a black hole: 5 PB
  - Powering the computer
    - A medium-sized data centre (15 MW) uses as much water as three average-sized hospitals

## Formula  
The carbon footprint of an algorithm depends on two factors: the energy needed to run it and the pollutants emitted when producing such energy. The former depends on the computing resources used (e.g., number of cores, running time, and data center efficiency) while the later, called carbon intensity, depends on the location and production methods used (e.g., nuclear, gas, or coal), see the [Electricity Map by Area](https://app.electricitymaps.com/map)

Carbon footprint (gCO2e) = energy used (kWh) * carbon intensity (gCO2e/kWh)
